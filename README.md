# vestacp-ipv6
This it's my IPV6 vestacp mod, it's all i need.
Hi guys this it's my mod for vestacp ipv6 i added in scripts to add ipv6 to nginx, it's all i need, i just want to add a website and setup ssl, and it's working. i'm not a pro but this it's my solution and to have the original vestacp in my server.
i'm always using force-https, after i add a domain or subdomain.. first i add ssl certificates and then i select force https, and my server it;s working on both ipv4 and ipv6.
